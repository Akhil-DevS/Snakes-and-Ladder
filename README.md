# Snakes-and-Ladder
Codes for Snakes and ladder simulation(MATLAB)
This repository contains three codes 
  1) To find average number of rounds to finish the standard version of the game using its transition matrix.
  2) Brute force simulation to find the average number of rounds to finish the game for the standard version of the game.
  3) ensemble simulation of snakes and ladders with varying density of snakes and ladders, to find out the distribution of number of rounds played to finish the game vs density
  4) Code to plot the distribution.
